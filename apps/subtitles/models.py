        There are a few rules checked here.

        First, versions cannot have more than one parent from a single language.
        For example, the following is invalid:

            en fr

            1
            |\
            \ \
             \ 2
              \|
               1

        Second, a parent cannot have a parent that precedes something existing
        in its own lineage.  It's easiest to understand this with an example.
        The following is invalid:

            en fr
            3
            |\
            2 \
            |  \
            1   \
             \   |
              \  |
               2 |
               |/
               1

        This is invalid because English was based off of French version 2, and
        then you tried to say a later version was based on French version 1.

        If English version 3 had been based on French version 2 (or later) that
        would be have been okay.

    Any other changes should simply create a new version.

    Second, SubtitleVersions are self-contained.  There's a little bit of
    denormalization going on with the video and language_code fields, but this
    makes it much easier for a SubtitleVersion to stand on its own and will
    improve performance overall.

    Because they're (mostly) immutable, the denormalization is less of an issue
